Final Project Progress Report

What has been implemented:
Local multiplayer for the most part works. The GUI and game logic work well together to produce something that can be played by two players on one machine.
    Parts of game logic that have been completed include:
        Getting which tiles are valid to move.
        Flipping the tiles after a move.
        Switching the between the players.
Online multiplayer works just as well as local multiplayer, with the caveat that there is no indication of which player you are currrently playing as.
The framework for playing against an AI has been developed, and an AI of moderate strength has been implemented.

What is currently being implemented:
A stronger AI is being developed.
A fancier frontend is also being developed.
    The framework for tile flipping animation has been developed but needs to be integrated into the backend.
    The frontend needs to show a message when a player has won.
    The frontend needs to have an indication of when the AI is thinking about its moves.
There should be more user-accessible options for the AI:
    Having the option to select different heuristic functions would be nice.
    Iterative deepening and selection of a time limit for the AI would be good.
    The user should be able to choose between different search algorithms.
Rigorous testing to ensure win conditions and correct passing of players.

What has not been implemented:
