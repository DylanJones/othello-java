Final Project Progress Report

What has been implemented:
Local multiplayer for the most part works. The GUI and game logic work well together to produce something that can be played by two players on one machine.
    Parts of game logic that have been completed include:
        Getting which tiles are valid to move.
        Flipping the tiles after a move.
        Switching the between the players.

What is currently being implemented:
A strong AI is being developed.
A fancier frontend is also being developed.
    The framework for tile flipping animation has been developed but needs to be integrated into the backend.
Rigorous testing to ensure win conditions and correct passing of players.

What has not been implement:
Multiplayer support has been started.
    Research has been done and we are reviewing variations of online Tic-Tac-Toe and attempting to mirror that in Othello.
